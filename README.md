Problem Statement

- Customer churn is a critical issue faced by businesses across industries. 
- Acquiring a new customer can cost 5–7 times more than retaining an existing one, and high churn rates directly reduce revenue and profitability. 
- The challenge for companies is not only to identify which customers are at risk of leaving, but also to understand the drivers behind churn so they can design proactive retention strategies.

- This project aims to predict customer churn risk using demographic, behavioral, and engagement data from an e-commerce platform. 
- The goal is to classify customers into “high risk” and “low risk” segments, enabling businesses to focus resources on retaining valuable customers before they leave.
